    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>Hello there! I'm Jack Conneely, a CS major at Harper College who's trying to create a sustainability fund there and who wants to be Dutch.</p>
    <p>Here's where you can find me:</p>
    <a href = "https://github.com/electricwapiti">GitHub</a>
    <br>
    <a href = "https://mastodon.social/@jackconneely">Mastodon</a>

    <p>Here's a summary of what I've done recently:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On my <a href = "https://mastodon.social/@jackconneely" >Mastodon</a>, I'm building a tool that automatedly summarizes New York Times articles about the climate and posts these summaries as well as their sentiment to Mastodon.

        <li><a href = "../../4.1+Webpages/index.html">4.1 Webpages</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's a summary of what I want to do by June 30 with 205 hours of time:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>5 hours:</b>Finish creating the </li>
        <li><b>120 hours</b>: Finish a ~120-hour Full Stack course where I learned some of this web design from.</li>
        <li><b>15 hours</b>: Finish the HuggingFace AI Agents Course. It's a cool introduction into creating AI agents yourself that can access tools. It's like ChatGPT using a web search or image generation tool.</li>
        <li><b>30 hours</b>: Finish the HuggingFace MCP Course. It shares how to give AI agents tools more easily. I heard it can help with my automatic image captioning project.</li>
        <li><b>10 hours</b>: Make this a good portfolio
            <ol>
                <li>Switch this website from bare HTML to something more modern like MD3 Design.</li>
                <li>Create a way to post something to Mastodon from a text box on this website.</li>
                <li>Make this a professional portfolio. Research options and implement one.</li>
            </ol>
        <li><b>15 hours</b>: Make a caption writing AI that captions all my photos.</li>
        <li><b>20 hours</b>: Data Structures. For each data structure
            <ol>
                <li>Take notes on it from Algomap and Visualgo.</li>
                <li>Create a test project for each data structure in Python and post it to GitHub.</li>
                <li>Consider trying LeetCode problems for each data structure with AlgoMap. :(</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
    </ol>
    <p>Here's a summary of what I want to do by July 15th with 105 hours of time:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>25 hours</b>: make an AI assistant which can schedule events in my Google Calendar. Also consider adding more tools and functionalities. Post it to GitHub.</li>
        <li><b>40 hours</b>: Make a web app in which users can play an animation of the polar ice cap melting. Uses React & Google Earth Engine polar ice data (python).</li>
        <li><b>30 hours</b>: Continue data structures. For each one:
            <ol>
                <li>Take notes on it from Algomap and Visualgo.</li>
                <li>Create a test project for each data structure in Python and post it to GitHub.</li>
                <li>Consider trying LeetCode problems for each data structure with AlgoMap. :(</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>10 hours</b>: Apply Full Stack by creating a web app that gives information about a company given the ticker symbol by scraping the web and possibly making an AI summary including the sentiment of each source.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>What else I do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Run</li>
        <li>Environmentalism
            <ul>
                <li>Harper Environmental Club</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to get more people interested in the push for solar and a student-controlled sustainability fund at Harper.</li>
                    <li>Petition outside concerts, parades, farmers markets, national holiday celebrations and other large public gatherings within Harper's district alongside other environmentalists.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Composting (It's an easy way to help limit greenhouse gas emissions! Making sure your local businesses, city and food pantry(s) compost is a great way to help mitigate the climate crisis.)</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Create a web app to give advice on how to solve climate change. Start by putting your entire lifestyle into a textbox and calculate carbon emissions from it. Make it open-source and get in contact with the old people who did it. Why did they stop? </li>
        <li><b>100 hours</b>Re-start the composting neighbor - connecting site becasue it stopped being maintained. The goal is for the old site to link to the new site. Buy servers run on donations to scale if necessary. </li>
        <li></li>
